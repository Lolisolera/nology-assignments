//EXPLAINED:
//The name, industry, start, and end variables are DOM elements, not plain objects. They represent HTML elements (<h2> or <p>) that 
//we create dynamically and later append to the DOM using JavaScript.

//The GOAL of this challenge is to dynamically display content on a webpage.
//The browser renders HTML elements, and these elements are part of the DOM.
//The data is stored in objects (e.g., the companies array).
//JavaScript uses the data to create corresponding DOM nodes (e.g., <h2>, <p>).
//The DOM nodes are added to the DOM, making them visible in the browser.
//If we only use objects, we would have no way to display the data in the browser. 
//Objects can hold the information but cannot render themselves on the page.
//Object represents the data, but to make it appear on the webpage, youâ€™d still need to convert it into DOM elements.
