## Companies Challenge

With the companies data provided:

-   Create a web page with at least one button and one container element
-   When the button is pressed, loop through the companies array, and for each object inside the array, render a card that contains all the information from the data.

### Extension

-   Replace the button with an input + label that will filter the rendered results by company name or industry (or both!)
-   The cards should now be displayed on page load instead of button press
