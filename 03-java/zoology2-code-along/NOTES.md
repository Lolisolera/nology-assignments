//INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ZOOLOGY CHALLENGE

/* 1 - 
//        In the package com.nology.zoology.animal
//
//      Create Tiger, Llama and Crocodile - have them inherit from the new
//      Animal class
//        Add a suitable constructor to each new class
//      
//        Ensure the makeSound() method overrides the parent's version
//        In the main method for of the ZooPlayground class:
//
//        Use the latest version of the classes to create your animals
//        Make sure to use the new constructors
//
//      Could you make the Animal getInformation() more useful, rather than having to override it?
